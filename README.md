# Sequence_Using_Linked_List
Implementing the Sequence Class using a linked list. Includes the Sequence3.cxx, Sequence3.h files and the node1.cxx and node1.h files.  For the Sequence class, the items in the sequence are stored in a linked list. 2. The head pointer of the list is stored in the member variable head_pointer. 3. The total number of items in the list is stored in the member variable many_nodes. 4. The tail_pointer member variable points to the tail node of the list. 5. The cursor points to the node containing the current item. It is used for attaching nodes. 6. The precursor points the node before the current node. It is used for inserting nodes. The node class implements the functions of the node class and the linked list toolkit. Seq_ex3 was not written by me and is used to test my sequence class.
